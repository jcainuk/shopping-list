## Introduction

This project is a simple shopping list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, remove, and filter items in their shopping list. I used this to practise my vanilla JavaScript knowledge and review the DOM.

You can also interact with a live demo of the project by visiting:

## Features

- Add items to the shopping list.
- Edit existing items in the list.
- Remove items from the list.
- Filter items based on user input.
- Clear all items from the list.

## Usage

### Adding Items

To add an item to the shopping list, simply enter the item in the input field and click the "Add Item" button.

### Editing Items

To edit an existing item in the list, click on the item you want to edit. The item will become editable, and you can make changes directly in the input field. Once done, press the "Update Item" button.

### Removing Items

To remove an item from the list, click on the "Remove" button next to the item.

### Filtering Items

To filter items in the list, enter the text you want to filter by in the filter input field. The list will update dynamically to display only items matching the filter text.
